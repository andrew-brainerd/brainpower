            <h3>header</h3>
            <p>The header section contains the UMCU Logo and the buttons for navigating between the check-in
                and check-out views. The buttons are positioned absolutely, so they really could sit anywhere
                in the DOM. I just thought they made sense near the top of the structure.</p>

        <div id="initialForm">
            <h3>initialForm</h3>
            <p>This section has a couple tables that comprise most of the user input as well as a few divs
                which are entirely populated after the page loads. This happens in either the JavaScript of
                PHP, depending on each section.</p>
            <div class="table">
                <h4>startInfo</h4>
                <p>This table hold the input fields that are required to get the check-in process started.
                    Users should start typing either their first or last name (which causes the search <i>div</i>
                    to populate with any available information from the database) and either continue as a
                    fresh, new visitor or build upon previous info if they have visited previously.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="table">
                <h4>moreInfo</h4>
                <p>This table has two different states, based on the previous user input. If the user selected
                    their previous information from the search area, the fields of this table are populated with
                    that data, in addition to the date of their last visit. If the user is a first time visitor,
                    the fields in this form will be blank and the last-visit input will not be shown.</p>
